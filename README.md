Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs


Explanation:
Conversion Functions: There are functions defined for each conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
convert_temperature Function: This function determines which conversions to perform based on the original unit of measurement.
main Function: This function prompts the user for the temperature value and the original unit, then calls convert_temperature to display the results.
